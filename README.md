## Description
This project is part of the module Big Data Analytics at HTW Berlin - Master Wirtschaftsinformatik.

#### Source Code <br>
* Clean Code
* Code conventions
* KISS/YAGNI
* runnable on every machine/ possible to deploy in a cloud environment - Tip: AWS Lambda!

#### Rough overview of the technologies used
* architecture diagram (draw.io) > https://aws.amazon.com/de/architecture/icons/
* Readme/ HowTo (*.md) > https://www.makeareadme.com

#### GitLab
A clean way of working in GitLab. Plan your work, use the function to estimate the amount of work and time invested.

#### Project tasks
##### A3.1 -  Data preparation & standardization
Please bring all files into a uniform structure. For the use of a NoSQL database there are extra points.

##### A3.2 - How big is the difference in the list / What % of IPs change per day?
only changing the IPs is enough (sometimes the port changes or other things).

##### A3.3 - 5 days current data from the Feodotracker
https://feodotracker.abuse.ch/downloads/ipblocklist_recommended.json
extra points for an automation script.

##### A3.4 - What is the difference in the IP lists from January 2022 to the current ones? / What % of IPs change per day in the current files?
only changing the IPs is enough (sometimes the port changes or other things)

##### A3.5 - Visual Report for A3.4
Here you have a free hand and can let off steam: Bar charts, time series or a map, etc. is fine here. Explain briefly why you have used this type of visualization.

##### A3.6 Create a wordcloud
Please create two word clouds with the country codes where most of the C&Cs can be found. 1x for January 2022 and once a current representation.

#### Used technologies
* Dynanmo DB
* AWS Lambda
* Local Python scripts

## How to execute & run

Before you can execute and run our code you need to install Python and the following library.

**Installed and used libraries**
* Boto3
```
pip install boto3
```

In this project we used AWS Lambda as an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as part of Amazon Web Services. Therefore we defined and used the following Lambda functions.

**Lambda Functions***
* AutomatedQueryFeodoDaily - https://oxc77jgxqgt4pv77ojwz22icbq0hcpsx.lambda-url.eu-central-1.on.aws/
* dataExportDynamoDB - https://j6a7cppundv7t2fsdwke3tpkiu0qwyoo.lambda-url.eu-central-1.on.aws/

Our code is runnable on every machine (Win, Linux, Mac).
